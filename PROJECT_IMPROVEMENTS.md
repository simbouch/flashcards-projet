**Date: May 16, 2025**

This document outlines the improvements made to the project structure to enhance maintainability, security, and organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Redundant Files
- Removed redundant test file (`test_app.py`) from the root directory
- Consolidated tests into their respective service directories
- Removed unnecessary database file from the root directory

### 2. Improved .gitignore Configuration
- Enhanced exclusion patterns for Python cache files (`__pycache__`)
- Added specific exclusions for log directories
- Configured uploads directory to exclude files but keep README

### 3. Cleaned Up Project Structure
- Removed redundant nested `flashcards-project` directory
- Consolidated uploads directories to a single location
- Added README to the uploads directory explaining its purpose

### 4. Added Production Recommendations
- Added comments in docker-compose.yml for production security improvements
- Documented the need for proper JWT secret key management
- Added recommendations for enabling health checks in all services
- Suggested resource limits for services

## Implemented Improvements

### Monitoring
- âœ… Enabled health checks for all services (OCR, LLM, Backend, Frontend)
  - Each service now has a health check endpoint that Docker will use to monitor service health
  - Docker will automatically restart services that fail their health checks
  - This provides basic self-healing capabilities for the application

## Future Improvements

### Security
- Implement proper secrets management for JWT keys and other sensitive data
- Consider using environment-specific configuration files
- Implement proper HTTPS for all services in production

### Performance
- Enable resource limits for all services
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Consider using a more robust database solution in production

### Monitoring
- Implement proper logging and monitoring with a tool like Grafana
- Set up alerting for service failures
