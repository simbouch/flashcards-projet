# Project Structure Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the project structure to enhance maintainability, security, and organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Redundant Files
- Removed redundant test file (`test_app.py`) from the root directory
- Consolidated tests into their respective service directories
- Removed unnecessary database file from the root directory

### 2. Improved .gitignore Configuration
- Enhanced exclusion patterns for Python cache files (`__pycache__`)
- Added specific exclusions for log directories
- Configured uploads directory to exclude files but keep README

### 3. Cleaned Up Project Structure
- Removed redundant nested `flashcards-project` directory
- Consolidated uploads directories to a single location
- Added README to the uploads directory explaining its purpose

### 4. Added Production Recommendations
- Added comments in docker-compose.yml for production security improvements
- Documented the need for proper JWT secret key management
- Added recommendations for enabling health checks in all services
- Suggested resource limits for services

## Future Improvements

### Security
- Implement proper secrets management for JWT keys and other sensitive data
- Consider using environment-specific configuration files
- Implement proper HTTPS for all services in production

### Performance
- Enable resource limits for all services
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Consider using a more robust database solution in production

### Monitoring
- Enable health checks for all services
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Set up alerting for service failures

## Conclusion

These improvements have enhanced the project structure by removing redundancy, improving organization, and adding documentation for future production deployment. The codebase is now more maintainable and follows better practices for development and deployment.
