Improve test structure and organization

This commit improves the test structure and organization of the Flashcards application:

- Organized test directory structure with proper unit/ and integration/ subdirectories
- Removed duplicate tests between tests/ and backend_service/tests/
- Added pytest markers to categorize tests by functionality and type
- Fixed circular import issues and database session handling
- Added comprehensive documentation for the test structure
- Created README.md files for each test directory
- Updated the main README.md with test structure information
- Ensured all tests pass with proper isolation

The test structure now follows best practices for FastAPI and SQLAlchemy testing:
- In-memory SQLite database for speed and isolation
- Session-per-test with rollback for test isolation
- Explicit model registration
- Single source of truth for DB URL
- Properly scoped fixtures
- Dependency overrides for FastAPI

All tests are now passing, and the test structure is well-organized and documented.

See TEST_STRUCTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md for detailed documentation of the changes.
